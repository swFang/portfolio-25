export const ABOUT_DESCRIPTION = `Hey there! I’m Daniel, and I'm a Software Engineer currently working at Arista Networks. When I’m not at my desk, I’m probably out with my camera, capturing life’s moments, or planning my next travel adventure. I love exploring new places and soaking up their history and culture.

Aside from being a tech enthusiast and a photography buff, I’m all about staying active through hockey, ultimate frisbee, working out and running. I’m always keen to try and learn new things while having fun along the way.

Welcome to my portfolio site! It’s where I share bits of my work and snippets of my adventures. Hope you enjoy browsing through it!`;
